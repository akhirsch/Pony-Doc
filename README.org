* Pony-Doc

This is the repository for the documentation for the Pony Compiler, a compiler for extended C, compiling into ANSI C99.

Pony was originally created for Senior Design at The George Washington University in 2010-2011 by Patrick Thomson. I have now inherited it, and am working on it for the 2012-2013 Senior Design at The George Washington University. Both Patrick and myself have worked under the mentorship of Professor Gabe Parmer.

Unfortunately, as this is an active school project, the source repository is closed now. This is merely a documentation repository.

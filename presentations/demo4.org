* Business issues

\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../pictures/business.jpg}

- Two businesses want to make a deal
- What needs to happen?
  - Negotiate a deal
  - Sign the paperwork
- What can be bad?
  - Misunderstandings can be devastating
  - Nothing should be binding until the paperwork is filled

* Communication is key

- How do businesses make sure nothings wrong?

\pause

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../pictures/lawyer.png}

- They use lawyers
- Lawyers know how to speak to each other
  - Makes bad things happen less often

* Communication among thieves (well, lawyers)

\includegraphics{../pictures/law-book-gavel.jpg}

- Lawyers need to make misunderstandings not happen
- Use appropriate protocols
- Now, everyone knows what that means!
- Companies do not talk without going through lawyers
* Now you've gone and put your foot in it
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{../pictures/oops.jpg}
- What happens when things DO go wrong?
\pause
- In come the lawyers again
- The lawyers can come in and fix the mistake
- Hopefully, the other businesses don't even notice \\ (These lawyers aren't the most moral sort)

* What on earth has this got to do with computers?
- Now you know my opinions on lawyers
- Let's get down to senior design
- Working in the ~Composite~ operating system
- ~Composite~ has different independent parts, /components/
- These are like the businesses from that last example.
#\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{../pictures/component_graph.png}
* So that was just bias against lawyers? 
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../pictures/morally_bankrupt.jpg}
- Where do the lawyers come in to this?
- The components need to be able to talk with each other
- Things shouldn't go wrong
- If they do, they should go right again
- No other components should notice!
* So about that project...
- I'm building the lawyers
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{../pictures/building_lawyers.jpg}
- Lawyers = /stubs/: Code that allows components to talk
- Before: stubs are generated by hand
- Now: generated automatically
* Automatic lawyer machine
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{../pictures/star-bellied.jpg}
- In composite, every component implements an /interface/
- This specifies what they can do as a list of functions
- Every function has a stub generated for it
- This project: language for describing interfaces:\\ /IDL/:  Interface Description Language \\ (Such a creative name, I know)
* How do lawyers talk to each other?
- Every interface also describes a /protocol/
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../pictures/fsm.jpg}
- Protocols can be thought of as how components communicate
- Similar to the protocols lawyers use
- These are also described in the IDL \\ (So it's not so uncreatively named after all!)
* Cleaning up the messes
- What happens when a component fails?
- It should "un-fail"
- Other components shouldn't notice!
- Understand what others expect it to
- Back to the same spot in IDL protocols
- Code generated automatically!
